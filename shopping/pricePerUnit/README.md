# Price per Unit

At this time, this script was made to find the best price per unit while shopping for groceries.
It is good for sites like Target, Shipt, Instacart, Same-Day Costco, and Amazon(Fresh/Whole Foods)

> This was not design for anyone to pick up and use anywhere. It was written with a fairly specific purpose in mind. Feedback and pull requests welcome to add more to the available domain list.

It currently has its limitations.
Known limitations:
- Instances where the product label has the total amount(in units), but also displays number of units


## Steps to use
1. Search for particular product
2. Copy, paste, and run script in console.
3. Depending on results, a confirmation might appear - approve or decline.
4. This script should show a modal with results. No modal appears if there are no results.
